# Welcome to MkDocs

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

## Getting Started

### Installation

MkDocs requires Python and pip to be installed on your system. You can install MkDocs using pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

For the Material theme (which this project uses), also install:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

### Creating a New Project

To create a new MkDocs project:

```bash
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project
```

This creates a basic project structure:

```
my-project/
    mkdocs.yml    # Configuration file
    docs/
        index.md  # Documentation homepage
```

### Configuration

The `mkdocs.yml` file is the configuration file for your MkDocs project. Here's a basic example:

```yaml
site_name: My Project Documentation
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
theme:
  name: material
```

## Writing Documentation

### Markdown Basics

MkDocs uses Markdown for writing documentation. Here are some basic formatting examples:

#### Headers
```markdown
# H1 Header
## H2 Header
### H3 Header
```

#### Text Formatting
- **Bold text**: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
- *Italic text*: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
- `Inline code`: `code`

#### Lists
Unordered lists:
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item
```

Ordered lists:
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

#### Links and Images
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Code Blocks

You can include code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More data |
| Row 2    | Data     | More data |

## Building and Serving

### Development Server

To start the development server and preview your documentation:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and automatically reload when you make changes.

### Building Static Site

To build the static site:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This creates a `site/` directory with the generated HTML files.

### Deployment

#### GitHub Pages

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

#### Manual Deployment

Build the site and upload the contents of the `site/` directory to your web server.

## Advanced Features

### Navigation Structure

You can organize your documentation using the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Getting Started:
    - Installation: getting-started/installation.md
    - Configuration: getting-started/configuration.md
  - User Guide:
    - Writing: user-guide/writing.md
    - Styling: user-guide/styling.md
  - API Reference: api.md
```

### Themes

MkDocs supports various themes. The Material theme offers many customization options:

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  palette:
    - scheme: default
      primary: blue
      accent: blue
  features:
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.sections
    - toc.integrate
```

### Plugins

Extend MkDocs functionality with plugins:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - minify:
      minify_html: true
```

Common plugins:
- `search`: Adds search functionality
- `minify`: Minifies HTML, CSS, and JS

```yaml
markdown_extensions:

  - codehilite
  - toc:
      permalink: true
```

#### Admonitions

Create callout boxes:

!!! note
    This is a note admonition.

!!! warning
    This is a warning admonition.

!!! tip
    This is a tip admonition.

## Best Practices
